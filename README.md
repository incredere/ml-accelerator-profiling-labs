> CUDA-only speedup in Level 2 (2.08x) is higher than wallclock speedup (1.37x) because CPU overhead and data loading are constant across both runs. The GPU kernel efficiency gain from AMP is the real story.
>
> In Level 3, matmul dominates GPU time at short sequence lengths — "attention is the bottleneck" is a long-context story. The O(T²) attention term only catches the O(T·d²) linear term at much longer sequences than we used here (seq_len=128).

## Lab progression

### Level 1 — GPU profiling with PyTorch Profiler

**Goal:** Understand GPU execution timeline and operator-level performance.

- Trains a feedforward network on FashionMNIST (batch size 256, 1 epoch)
- Captures CPU + CUDA execution traces using `torch.profiler`
- Exports `.pt.trace.json` for Perfetto visualization
- Identifies top operators by CUDA time: `aten::linear`, backward pass, optimizer step

**Key finding:** Backward pass consistently takes longer than forward pass. CPU→GPU data transfer latency is minimal relative to compute.

### Level 2 — Mixed precision profiling (FP32 vs AMP)

**Goal:** Quantify the performance impact of mixed precision training.

- Runs identical workload under FP32 baseline and PyTorch AMP (FP16)
- Captures separate trace files: `fp32.pt.trace.json`, `amp.pt.trace.json`
- Compares elapsed time, CUDA kernel time, and memory usage

**Key finding:** AMP cuts CUDA kernel time by 2.08x by running eligible ops in FP16. Wallclock speedup is 1.37x — lower than CUDA speedup because CPU and data loading overhead is unchanged.

### Level 3 — Transformer profiling (GPT-2 style on T4)

**Goal:** Identify where GPU time actually goes during one training step of a decoder-only transformer, and back every claim with numbers parsed directly from a Kineto trace.

- 6-layer GPT-2 style model (d_model=512, 8 heads × 64 dim, d_ff=2048, vocab=50257)
- Batch 8, seq_len 128, Tesla T4, PyTorch `torch.profiler` with CUDA activity
- Captures a Kineto trace across 3 active steps (266.65 ms of GPU kernel time)
- Buckets 1,405 GPU kernels by role and cross-checks against CPU-side annotations

**Key findings:**

- **Matmul dominates, attention does not.** cuBLAS sgemm kernels account for 53.50% of GPU time. Memory-efficient attention (CUTLASS FMHA, fwd + bwd) is only 6.77%.
- **Backward runs 1.99x forward, for the right reason.** Each linear layer launches two sgemms in backward (grad w.r.t. activations + grad w.r.t. weights) versus one in forward. The kernel table confirms it: `sgemm_*_tn` + `sgemm_*_nt` (backward) ≈ 2x `sgemm_*_nn` (forward).
- **Adam is not free.** ~20% of GPU time is spent in `multi_tensor_apply` kernels. Fused / foreach optimizers exist for a reason.

### Level 4 — Kernel roofline analysis (GPT-2 on T4)

**Goal:** Move beyond *where* GPU time goes (Level 3) to *whether each operation is using the GPU efficiently*. Apply the Roofline model — the standard framework GPU performance engineers use to decide what to optimize.

- For each kernel category, computes FLOPs from the model architecture and bytes from tensor shapes
- Cross-references against Level 3's measured kernel times to compute achieved performance
- Classifies each kernel against the T4's compute roof (8.1 TFLOPS FP32) and memory roof (320 GB/s)
- Produces a roofline plot showing every kernel relative to the hardware ceiling

**Key findings:**

- **FFN matmul: AI = 146 FLOPs/byte, achieved 1.63 TFLOPS (20% of FP32 peak).** Compute-bound — would benefit most from Tensor Cores via FP16/BF16.
- **Attention QK^T: AI = 16, just below FP32 ridge of 25.** Memory-bound at S=128; shifts compute-bound at longer sequences (this is why FlashAttention matters more at long context).
- **LayerNorm: AI = 1, 1.4% of peak.** Severely memory-bound — the fix is kernel fusion, not faster math.
- **Elementwise: AI = 0.08, 0.03% of peak.** Catastrophically memory-bound — same fix.

**The big idea:** as compute scales faster than bandwidth, more ops become memory-bound. This is why every new GPU generation (Volta → Hopper → Blackwell) ships with more memory bandwidth, not just more FLOPs.
